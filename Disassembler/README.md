CMSC 131 Lab Disassembler Repository
====================================


How to use:

1.) Run the jar file in cmd (java -jar Disassembler.jar).

2.) Once a pop-up menu appears, type the mode you want to use ([1]Java to Assembly OR [2]Assembly to Java).

3.) On the command promt, type the file name of the file that you want to convert (file extension must be included).

4.) After entering the file name of your choice, the converted version will be written on the same filename as your original file.

5.) Execute the converted file for testing.

That's it!


Extra notes:

- This project might not successfully accomplish everything under the professor's test cases so to make up for this possibility, we included a set of our own test cases (Disassembler/test/) This may serve as other reference points as to how our project handles the case of using certain functions in assembly and/or in java.

- There is only a single file for testing for each method (assembly.asm for asm->java and main.java for java->asm). We already included different functionalities in each sich as printing, handling if else blocks, and handling different loops.
