Assembly to Java:

1. Names of Labels:
-> if_block - for the if statement
-> endiflabe - for the end if statement
-> elselabe - for the else statement
-> endelselabe - for the end else statement
-> looplabe - start of the loop
-> endlooplabe - end of loop
*labels can have numbers after because the program can handle multiple if else and loop statements
(e.g. if_block2 and endiflabe2 of the second if-else statement in the code)

2. Names of Registers:
-> al - used in if else statements (moving the variables to al register when comparing)
-> bl - used in loop statements (moving the variables to bl register when comparing)

3. Declaration of variables
-> All variables declared in assembly are assumed have the 'db' size

4. If else
-> Printing of outputs and incrementing/decrementing the variables can be performed inside the if and else statements

5. Loop
-> The loop in disassembly is converted to the do-while loop in java

6. Miscellaneous
-> Printing of outputs, if else statements and loop statements are not limited
-> Printing of outputs, if else statements and loop statements can be placed anywhere in the code
